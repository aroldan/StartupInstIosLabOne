# Modify the UITableView to show the number of each aisle as well as the name.

The layout for the UITableViewCells are defined in storyboard files.

Which UIViewController in the storyboard shows you cells? The lower right corner of Interface Builder shows you all the OS-defined components you can add to your view. Find "Label" in the list and drag it into your cell.

Activate the assistant editor by clicking the "bow tie guy" icon in the top left of xcode. What View file is associated with each cell?

Once you have your view set up, you need to populate the data. Where in the code is the name being set? How can we modify that to set the number as well?
